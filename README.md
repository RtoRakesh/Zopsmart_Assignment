# Traffic Light Component üö¶

This project demonstrates a simple traffic light component implemented in React. The traffic light cycles through **green**, **yellow**, and **red** states automatically, simulating real-world traffic light behavior.

## Traffic Light Flow

- **Yellow** ‚û°Ô∏è **Red**: 2 seconds
- **Red** ‚û°Ô∏è **Yellow**: 5 seconds
- **Yellow** ‚û°Ô∏è **Green**: 2 seconds

The cycle repeats indefinitely.

## Features
